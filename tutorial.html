      <h1>Welcome to the death field, Adventurer!</h1>
      <h5>You've heard it right. DEATH FIELD... "Read it right" actually. Doesn't matter!<br>
        You come here with ONE sole reason is to eliminate as many orcs ravaging the land as possible. I would like to tell you all about the story behind this land, Mordor...riel. <br>
        Yeah! Mordoriel. I totally didn't snatch this name from somewhere but let's call it Mordor for short. Anyway, Mordor has always been a land of chaos and war. Turmoil rules the land here, and also orcs. <br>
        That is where you come in my conveniently overpower level 100 warrior friend! To kick orc hinds! Or use your sword, that works too.
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="images/hero.png" alt="HEROOO"> This is you tiny friend. Don't let your own looks deceive you! You're actually very capable of beheading the orcs</li>
        <li><img src="images/monster.png" alt="Lower being - Orc"> So these guys are the small frys you gotta wipe out. They travel in hordes soooo....Get ready to get crazy</li>
        <li><img src="images/slime.png" alt="Bad gooy stuff"></li> This disgusting giant snot is a Slime. You have to avoid this one. Since it's gelly, your sword will pass through. It's common sense, come on! Also its content is acidic <i class="fas fa-grimace"></i>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <h2>Button instruction</h2>
        <p>Use your arrows on the keyboard to move to slaying the orcs and tuck tail run away from Slimes <br>
          Oh and you've got only 15 seconds to have fun with the orcs. Good news is you can earn more time by defeating more orcs! Cool ha? <br>
          That's it! Head in there and try not to die my friend or I'll loot your body later hehe
